     <div class="drop dd-button"><i class="down"></i></div>
     <div class="hide">To buy players you would need to register a team. It costs Â£10 for which you would be given 100,000 chips using which you can purchase players at an auction that would be held before start of the season. Named/Capped players will be available at a defined base price from which the  bidding starts.</div>

    <div class="hide">Based on the playing patterns in last couple of seasons, we have selected players who have played considerable 
	    amount of games. These players would be requested for consent to be made available as named/capped players in 
	    6 categories namely Batsman, Bowler, All Rounder, Super Batsman, Super Bowler and Super All rounder. 
	    Each category is entered into auction as a different player and set at different base prices for

    <div class="hide">All named/capped players in 6 categories namely Batsman, Bowler, All Rounder, Super Batsman, Super Bowler and Super All rounder. The categories define how you earn points. 
	    <ul>
		    <li>For a player in batsman category you would earn points based on his batting but not bowling</li>
		    <li>For a player in bowler category you would earn points based on his bowling but no batting</li>
		    <li>For a player in All rounder category you would earn points on both batting and bowling</li>
		    <li>For a player in super category you would do the same, except that you would double all bowling and batting points</li>

	    You do not need to specify which eleven players you choose for a game as points will be earned for all purchased players. 
	    Please refer to the list below for a comprehensive breakdown of points.
	    <br>

	    And then a few twisters to decrease predictability.
	    <ul>
		    <li>Batsmen and all-rounders who remain not out or run out or LBW at the end of an innings will earn 5 points, which includes the super category.  These points are not doubled and is applicable only for named/capped players</li>
		    <li>Bowlers and all-rounders who bowl in an innings but bowl less than or equal to 50% of the maximum allowance will earn 5 points, including the super category. These points are not doubled and is applicable only for named/capped players</li>
		    <li>A winning game earns 25% extra points on all points earned. This point is rounded to the base integer  [i.e 10.9 will be 10 points, not 11]) and is applicable for both named/capped and unnamed players.</li>
		    <li>All points earned during a tour will be doubled up, and this is applicable for both named/capped and unnamed players.</li>
		    <li>All points in non stats matches (ex: chairman's game etc) will be tripled,, and this is applicable for both named/capped and unnamed players</li>		    
	    </ul>
	    At the end of the auction, all remaining chips will be converted into points at a rate of 1 point per <span class="highlight">100</span> chips. 
	    Teams with less than 10 players will receive a <b>penalty of 50 points per game</b>

	  Few rules on how to use these cards:
      <ul>
        <li>Prior to the auction, you must submit the name of the player you wish to price match. This must be done at least 5 days prior to the auction.</li>
        <li>These players will be auctioned first, starting with the highest-priced player from the previous year's auction. Once the bidding is over, you will be asked if you would like to purchase the player.</li>
        <li>You should not participate in the bidding process for this player and wait for your turn to be asked to price match; otherwise, the option will be invalidated.</li>

	   <div class="ques"><span class="highlight">What are Game cards and Player cards</span></div>
     <div class="drop dd-button"><i class="down"></i></div>
     <div class="hide">As part of the auction, a new set of cards will be introduced that allow you to control point scoring and certain actions during the season. <br>
	     Here's how they work:
     <h4>Game cards</h4>
      <p>These cards allow you to nominate a match where points are doubled or tripled, based on the card. 
	 However, you cannot use this card on matches that are already doubled or tripled, such as tour, charity, and other nominated games where doubling or tripling is pre-set. 
	 When you use this card, the points will be doubled or tripled for everyone, not just you.</p>
     <h4>Player cards</h4>
      <p>These cards allow you to nominate a player (not just their category or nomination) whose points are doubled or tripled, based on the card. 
	 For example, if you own Player A as a Super Batman and Super All-Rounder, and someone else owns them as a Super Bowler and Bowler, they would benefit too.
       </p>
     <h4>Pre vs Post match game and player cards</h4>
	Both game and player cards come in two types: pre-match and post-match. 
      <ul>
	<li>For pre-match cards, you should request the use of the card before 12 PM on the day of the game</li>
        <li>For post-match cards, you should request the use of the card before midnight after the game ends</li>
       </ul>
       The exact number of cards and types will be published closer to the auction
